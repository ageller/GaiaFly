# GaiaFly

This is an interactive WebGL viewer for Gaia data, built using [Firefly](https://github.com/ageller/Firefly).  There are additional features here that have not yet been incorporated into Firefly, but are forthcoming. 

A live version is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/GaiaFly/).

For general documentation about the controls, please see the [Firefly wiki page](https://github.com/ageller/Firefly/wiki).
